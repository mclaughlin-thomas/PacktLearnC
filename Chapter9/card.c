// The card variable is the overall name for a variable of five componentsâ€”suit, suitValue, face,
// faceValue, and isWild. When the card variable is declared, enough space must be allocated
// to hold all the values of the components within it. If we assume that the enum types are 4 bytes and
// bool is 1 byte, then the result of sizeof( card ) would be 17. So, each time a variable of the
// struct Card type is declared, 17 bytes would be allocated for it

// THis is not the case though. We actually have 20 bytes. This is because od something behind the scenes called structure allignement, where
// a given structure is paeed with enough space so that it contains an even multiple of its largest component. In the case of struct Card, it
// is padded with 3 bytes so that it will occupy an even multiple of 4, with 4 bytes being the largest size of any component in struct Card.
